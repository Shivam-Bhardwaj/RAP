# Self-Hosting vs GitLab Comparison

## Quick Decision Guide

### Choose Self-Hosting If:
- ✅ You have a server/VPS already
- ✅ Need unlimited storage
- ✅ Want full control over data
- ✅ Have technical expertise
- ✅ Want to avoid external dependencies

### Choose GitLab If:
- ✅ Want zero setup time
- ✅ OK with 10GB limit (sufficient for this project)
- ✅ Want managed hosting
- ✅ Need collaboration features
- ✅ Prefer less maintenance

## For This Project (235MB dataset)

**Recommendation: GitLab** (simpler, sufficient)

**But if you have a server:** Self-hosting is also great!

## Quick Setup Comparison

### GitLab (5 minutes)
```bash
1. Create account at gitlab.com
2. Create repository
3. Run: ./setup_gitlab_lfs.sh USERNAME REPO
4. Push: git push gitlab main && git lfs push gitlab main --all
```

### Self-Hosted (30 minutes)
```bash
1. Get VPS/server
2. Run: ./setup_self_hosted_lfs.sh lfs.yourdomain.com
3. Configure DNS and SSL
4. Push: git lfs push origin main --all
```

## Storage Comparison

| Solution | Free Storage | Setup Time | Maintenance |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| **GitLab** | 10GB | 5 min | None |
| **Self-Hosted (VPS)** | Unlimited | 30 min | Low |
| **GitHub** | 1GB | 0 min | None (but forks blocked) |

## Cost Analysis

**GitLab:** $0/month (10GB free)
**Self-Hosted:** $5-20/month (unlimited, but needs server)

For 235MB: GitLab is perfect and free!
